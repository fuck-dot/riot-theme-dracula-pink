# riot-theme-dracula-pink
theme for the [revolution fork](https://gitlab.eastcoast.hosting/ponies/riot-web) of element using dracula colors and lots of pink (might also work for regular element but idk and revolution is cooler anyways so use that they got costum emojis and stuff like that)

just add this to stylus and you should be done!
